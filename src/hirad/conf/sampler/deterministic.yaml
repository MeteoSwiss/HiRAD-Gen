# Deterministic sampler is generally faster than stochastic sampler, but should theoretically produce worse results.
# Deterministic sampler is not implemented correctly in this codebase and shouldn't be used.

type: deterministic
params:
  num_steps: 9 
  # Number of denoising steps
  solver: euler
  # ODE solver type: euler is the simplest solver
